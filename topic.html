<p class = "paragraphs">	From its birth in the early 1990’s, and the creation of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, Stan, Binge, and various video-game streaming services such as Twitch and Youtube- the industry has boomed. According to SurveyMonkey, roughly 27% of participants in their survey aged 18-29 prefer streaming services. This is in comparison to the 16% who solely prefer broadcast Television; the rest watch both.<a href = "https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/how-do-consumers-feel-about-streaming-services-vs-cable/"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Due to this boom, and the rapid decline in popularity of Broadcast television, there will be a time in which the majority of news and television will be consumed via streaming services.

<h2>What are related technologies?</h2>
<p class =  "paragraphs">Related technologies is something such as Youtube which is a streaming service, however, the content that is uploaded onto the website is not studio quality films or TV shows.
